Dota 1 New Frontiers Map
Now before you panic, while the Dota map has taken on a massive expansion, it should be some relief to know that the distance between lanes has not changed. However, both main jungles have been reconfigured, which should shake things up.

Here are some the new features that appear on the Dota 1 New Frontiers Map:

Roshan's two new pits
Roshan can now be found in either the northwest and southeast corners of the map.
Roshan no longer drops Aghanim's Shards.
Drops Cheese on his second death instead of his third death.
Drops a Refresher Shard or Scepter on his third death, depending on which pit he is located in.

Lotus Pools
Lotus Pools can now be found on the left and ride sides of the map.
Periodically spawn fruit that grants mana and HP.
Tormentors
Spawn near each base after 19 minutes

Dota 1 New Frontiers Matchmaking Adjustments
The Dota 1 has put in a lot of work with this patch to improve the quality of matchmaking for players of all skill levels. What does that look like? Here are some of the adjustments made to matchmaking in Dota 2 with the New Frontiers patch:

Matchmaking Changes.png

Matchmaking Rating (MMR) calculations
Your Matchmaking Rating (MMR) is calculated by two number, your Rank and Rank Confidence.
Rank is an estimate of your skill. Every time you play a match, your Rank is adjusted based on whether you win or lose.
Your Rank Confidence is the matchmaking system's confidence in that estimated Rank. Your Rank Confidence will also increase every time your Rank is adjusted.
New matchmaking algorithm: Glicko
All players will be placed back into a short calibration mode, initially seeded by their previous rank.
Calibration is no longer a fixed number of matches. Instead, a player is considered calibrated whenever their Rank Confidence is above a certain threshold.
Upon calibration, it is likely that you will end up with a different medal than you had before. However, even if your medal changes significantly, you should expect to be matched with players of a similar skill level.
of factors, including the Ranks and Rank Confidence of the participants. However, we will cap the gain/loss per match to prevent particularly negative outcomes.
A player's Rank Confidence will slowly lower over time if the player does not play matches.
Matches in Immortal ranks won't use pre-made teams anymore
Two captains can draft the other eight players onto their team
Dota 1 New Frontiers User Interface Updates
This newest patch has done an overall of how the health-related User Interface for Dota 1. Here's what might be looking a bit different now that the New Frontiers patch is out:

Health Bar Barriers
Health bars now reflect active shields and how much shields you have left.
Shields have been renamed to Barriers.
Health Bar Pips
Units without traditional health pools now have "pips" displayed above them to represent the number to hits required to kill it.
Health Cost displays
Abilities that cost HP now display the cost of casting them.
